# Blynk LED Control System

## Overview

This project allows you to control an LED using the Blynk platform. Blynk is a powerful Internet of Things (IoT)
platform that enables easy control and monitoring of devices through a mobile app. In this case, we use Blynk to remotely 
control the state of an LED connected to an Arduino.

## Features

- Control an LED remotely through the Blynk app.
- Simple and easy-to-understand Arduino codebase.
- Customizable for integration into your projects.

## Requirements

- Arduino board (e.g., Arduino Uno, Nano, etc.)
- LED and resistor (for testing)
- Blynk account and mobile app installed
- Arduino IDE installed on your computer

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
  bash
  git clone https://github.com/amresh08/Blynk-ledcontrol.git

2. Open the Arduino IDE and navigate to File > Open. Select the blynk_led_control.ino file from the cloned repository.

3. Install the required Blynk library. You can do this by going to Sketch > Include Library > Manage Libraries and searching for "Blynk." Install the latest version.

4. Configure your Blynk authentication token in the auth variable of the Arduino code.

Blynk Setup
Create a new project in the Blynk app.
Add a "Button" widget to the project.
Set the Button's output to "V1" in the widget settings.
Obtain the authentication token from the Blynk app and replace the placeholder in the Arduino code with your actual token.
Usage
Modify the code as needed for your specific LED and pin configuration.

Upload the code to your Arduino board.

Open the Blynk app, connect to your project, and use the button widget to control the LED.

Make sure to replace placeholder information such as "your-username," "YourAuthToken," "YourWiFiSSID," and "YourWiFiPassword" with your actual details. Adjust the example code based on your LED's pin configuration and any additional features you may want to implement.
